Morse Code Communication Device using SensorTag

Project in Collaboration with @Sofyaiv

Overview

This project develops a communication device using the SensorTag board, enabling agents to send and receive secret messages encoded in Morse code. The device uses the MPU9250 sensor to detect specific movements or button presses, translating them into Morse code symbols (dots, dashes, and spaces). These symbols are transmitted to a workstation via UART, where they are decoded into text. The device can also receive Morse-coded messages and present them to the user using LEDs or a buzzer.
